# Composition of Yellow Pine and Mixed-Conifer Forests Over Time

Forest managers often use knowledge about functional, compositional, and structural characteristics of historic forests to guide modern day forest management. Currently, historic conditions for yellow pine mixed conifer (YPMC) forests specific to Southern California are not well known.  However, these forests provide critical ecological services such as watershed stability, hydrological function, carbon stage, habitat, and support of proper fire regimes. A better understanding of the current condtions of Southern california YPMC forests and how these conditions have deviated from past conditions will help aid in forest management efforts to better preserve this ecosystem.

This webpage is part of a larger project evaluating past, present, and future conditions of YPMC forests in southern California. Here, we will focus on tree density in these forests over time. A century of fire suppression has altered forest structure and composition. Current forests are significantly denser than a hundred years ago, which has resulted in wildfires that are larger and more severe than historic norms (Nigro & Molinari, 2019). Today’s fires are more costly to suppress, resulting in increased property and ecosystem damage, and are more deadly (Noss et al., 2006; Stephens et al., 2016; Van Wagtendonk et al., 2018). Forest densification also increases drought stress and susceptibility to bark-beetle attack. Thus, restoring forests to conditions that reduce drought stress and reduce the threat of severe wildfires is a top priority for forest managers. This webpage will provide a brief glipse into the recent densification of Southern California YPMC forests.

#### The following species are included in our analysis:

##### 		Pines

- Abies concolor

- Calocedrus decurrens

- Pinus coulteri

- Pinus jeffreyi

- Pinus lambertiana

- Pseudotsuga macrocarpa

- Pinus ponderosa

  ##### Oaks

- Quercus chrysolepis

- Quercus kelloggii

#### Data was obtained from the following sources:

##### Historic

Wieslander plot data and photos made available by UC Berkeley’s Vegetation Type Map (VTM) project. Plot data and photos were collected in the late 1920s- early 1930s. 

##### Current

Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data made available by the US Forest Service.

**Figure 1: Historic and Current YPMC Tree Density.** Preliminary analysis illustrates that current YPMC forests are denser than historic forests ( 367 trees/hectare as compared to 226 trees/hectare.
